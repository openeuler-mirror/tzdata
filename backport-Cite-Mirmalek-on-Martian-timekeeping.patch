 Solar Time A" and "Local Solar Time B" for its two missions, each zone

+The A and B zones differ enough so that an MER worker assigned to
+the A zone might suffer "Mars lag" when switching to work in the B zone.
 Such a "time zone" is not particularly suited for any application
 other than the mission itself.
